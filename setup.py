Operating Environment Inspection
-------------------------------------

Espy is a simple way to check the environment in which your code will run:

    # Boiler plate sanity check
    
    python >= 2.7
    
    # Make sure we have MongoDB and Drivers
    
    py pymongo >= 2.1.0
    
    cmd mongod >= 2.0.0
    
    # Track down Solaris GCC install
    
    cmd /usr/sfw/bin/gcc >= 4.0

Espy makes it easy to check Python Modules and external commands.
